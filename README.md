This project includes focuses on analyzing customer churn in the banking sector using an Power BI dashboard to visualize and understand customer behaviour patterns. The analysis identifies key factors contributing to customer attrition, providing actionable insights so that the bank can develop targeted strategies to improve customer retention and overall satisfaction.

## Tools Used 
- Power Query : For data cleaning and transformation
- DAX (Data Analysis Expression): For creating Calculated Columns and Metrics
- Power BI : For designing interactive visuals and dashboard 

## Key Metrics 
- **Total Customers**: 10,000
- **Customers Churned**: 2037
- **Churn Rate**: 20.4%

## Approach
1. **Data Source**: The dataset was provided as a CSV file including customers data. 
2. **Data Extraction**: Imported the data from CSV file into Power BI.
4. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Cleaned the extracted data by removing unwanted columns and standardized data formats. 
5. **Data Visualization**: Designed a interactive dashboard to analyze churn trends.
